## Interlinear gloss
Interlinear gloss of the original Aeolic Greek fragment, seperated by stanzas, and by individual sentences from within the stanzas.

### Stanza 1
| Greek word       | Type  | Gloss | Meaning |
|------------------|-------|-------|---------|
| φαίνεταί | Verb | 3rd. sg. md. φαίνω | [He/she/it] appears |
| μοι           | Pronoun | enclitic dat. sg. | me |
| κῆνος      | Demonstrative Pronoun | masc. (?) ἐκεῖνος | that |
| ἴσος        | Adjective | masc. (?) | same |
| θέοισιν   | Noun | Thessalian form of dat. pl. θεοῖς | the gods |

#### Preliminary Translation:
He appears to me that the same as the Gods.

#### Translator's notes:
* κῆνος	and ἴσος are both declined in the masculine form, so the subject of the sentence is presumably male.

| Greek word       | Type  | Gloss | Meaning |
|------------------|-------|-------|---------|
| ἔμμεν᾽   | Verb | ἔμμεναι, εἶναι | to be |
| ὤνηρ,       | Noun | masc. nom. ὁ ἀνήρ | the man/husband |
| ὄττις      | Pronoun (?) | masc. (?) nom. (?) | whoever/whichever |
| ἐνάντιός| Adjective | masc. nom. | opposite / facing |
| τοι           | Pronoun | N/A | You |

#### Preliminary Translation:
The man whoever to be opposite you.

#### Translator's notes:
* ἐνάντιός is in the same declension as ὤνηρ, hence it must be modifying ὤνηρ.
* Likewise the same has to be said of ὄττις.

| Greek word       | Type  | Gloss | Meaning |
|------------------|-------|-------|---------|
| ἰσδάνει  | Verb | 3rd. sg. ἰζάνω | He/she/it sits |
| καὶ          | Conjunction | N/A | and |

| φωνεί-      | Verb (?) | Unclear, noted as "Aeolic present participle" in gen. sg. fem. | speak, give utterance |

#### Preliminary Translation:
And he sits close to you, [you] speak[ing] sweetly

#### Translator's notes:
* Although much of the words are unclear, it is important to distinguish between the masculine subject and the feminine actor. In the sentence, πλάσιον is masculine, presumably applying to the actor of ἰσδάνει, while φωνεί is feminine, presumably applying to the narrator.

## Technical Details
### Compiling document
In order to compile latex source files, run `make` in the terminal:
```
cd latex
make
make clean
```

Note: for any partial compiles where compilation fails at a certain point, you
should run `make clean` followed by make again. Trying to run make after a
failed compile would result in additional errors.

### Dependencies
This template uses a makefile to compile the latex source files. The makefile
uses `latexmk`, which runs latex the correct number of times. This is because
due to the presense of figures, tables, and biblatex databases, latex needs to
be called multiple times in some cases. Latexmk should be included in your
latex installation, but if it is now, you may download it here:

* http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8//software/latexmk-jcc/

Additionally, this template uses XeLaTeX by default, as it allows the inclusion
of unicode characters in the latex source files. If XeLaTeX is not installed, or
plain LaTeX is required, simply alter the `makefile` at the appropriate call:

```
# MAIN LATEXMK RULE
$(source_name).pdf: $(source_name).tex
  ...
	latexmk -pdf -xelatex -use-make $<
```

XeLaTeX allows one to use foreign characters like ü or æ natively in the latex
source files, though. So it's probably a good idea to install XeLaTeX:

* http://xetex.sourceforge.net/
